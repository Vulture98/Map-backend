You are tasked with building a task management application similar to Trello. The application
will allow users to create, update, and manage tasks within different columns. Users should
be able to move tasks between columns using drag-and-drop functionality. Additionally,
users should be able to sign up and log in, including the option to log in via Google.

Ensure routing is implemented throughout the application.
